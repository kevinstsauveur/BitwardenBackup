# Security Policy

I take the security of my software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through my GitHub.

The security of your data is important for me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
